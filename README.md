# Mobile-Game-Success-Prediction
The goal of this project is to predict the success of mobile strategy games based on certain gaming features. Different regression and classification models were designed such as linear regression, neural network, logistic regression, decision tree, and random forest in order to determine the model that provided the most optimal results. The models were developed using data scraped from Apple’s iTunes API and website. Different mobile application features such as the number of ratings, price, age demographic, size, release date, and other features were used to determine a game’s future success. An application’s average user rating was selected as a metric for success and a rating of 3.5 or greater was considered successful. The goal of this project is to predict the average user rating for a mobile strategy game, therefore, this feature was the target class during modeling. All the models were evaluated in order to compare performance and determine the optimal result.
